# HSA (Hydrological Signature Analysis)

HSA is a R package dedicated to the computation of hydrological signatures based on streamflow, precipitation and air temperature time series.

Details on the implemented signatures can be found in Horner (2020) and Horner et al. (2020).

# Getting started

## Installation

I recommend you use the devtools package to install the HSA package:

```splus
install.package("devtools")
```

To install the package using devtools, run the following commands:

```splus
library(devtools)
install_github("IvanHeriver/hsa-R-package")
```

## Basic usage

Load the package:

```
library(HSA)
```
